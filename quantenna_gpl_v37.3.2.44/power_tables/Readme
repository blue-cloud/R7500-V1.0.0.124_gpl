This directory have the power table and power_selection.conf files for different platform configurations.

For QTN devices, there are 2 directories which are used to store power tables -- "/proc/bootcfg/" and "/etc/power_tables/", the former is in uboot config block and it is independent of image, the latter is built into image.
Since there are two places for power tables, to search for the target power table, we defined 4 kinds of power selection mode which define the sequence of searching, as below,

0 - Search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/" only, it is the default mode.
1 - Search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/" at first, if not find, then search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/";
2 - Search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/" at first, if not find, then search for the target power table in "/proc/bootcfg/";
3 - Search for the target power table in "/etc/power_tables/" only;

To set the power selection mode as "x", please define "power_selection=x" in power_table.conf which locates in SDK directory "power_tables/<board_config>/".


For the name of power table, it must be one of below two formats,

tx_power_QSR1000_<region>.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_<region>.txt (for STA mode only)

For example,

tx_power_QSR1000_us.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_eu.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_us.txt
tx_power_QSR1000_sta_eu.txt


Note:

The power tables in original SDK are for QTN RDK boards, if you want to enable the power tables in "/etc/power_tables/", please replace them with your power tables which match your boards.
